<ul><li>
<p>A one_through_one association type has been added.  This is similar to the many_to_many association type in that it uses a join table, but it returns a single record instead of an array of records. This is designed for cases where the foreign key in the join table that references the current table has a unique constraint, or where you want to use an order to just pick the first matching record.</p>

<p>Similarly, the many_through_many plugin now also offers a one_through_many association.</p>
</li><li>
<p>An association_join method has been added to model datasets, for setting up joins based on associations.  This basically does the same join that eager_graph would do, but does not make the other changes that eager_graph makes.</p>

<p>Unlike eager_graph (which uses LEFT OUTER JOINs by default), association_join uses INNER JOINs, but there are also association_*_join methods (e.g. association_left_join) for using different join types.</p>

<p>Similar to eager_graph, you can use cascading of associations or multiple associations.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Album</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">association_join</span>(<span class="ruby-value">:artist</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:tracks</span>)
<span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">association_left_join</span>(<span class="ruby-value">:albums</span><span class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">:tracks</span>)
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#eager_graph_with_options has been added for model datasets.  It currently supports a :join_type option, for overriding the type of join to use on a per-call basis, as well as a :limit_strategy option.  The API is similar to eager_graph, except that the associations to eagerly load are passed in as a single argument, and it takes an options hash.</p>

<p>The :limit_strategy option works similarly to the :eager_limit_strategy option when eagerly loading.  If set to true and the database supports window functions, it will join the current dataset to a subquery that uses a window function to correctly restrict the join to only those objects that fall within the association’s limit/offset.</p>

<p>The :limit_strategy option is not on by default.  It is possible for it to perform significantly worse than the default strategy (which uses array slicing in ruby).  The :limit_strategy significantly changes the SQL used, and can change the results of the query if any filters/orders related to the association are used.</p>

<p>It’s recommended you only use the :limit_strategy option if you are experiencing a bottleneck and you have benchmarked that it is faster and still produces the desired results.</p>

</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#full_text_search on PostgreSQL now supports :plain and :phrase options.  :plain takes the search terms as a single string, and searches for rows where all terms are used. :phrase is similar to :plain, but also adds a substring search to ensure that the string given appears verbatim in the text.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A :graph_order association option has been added, for using a different order when using eager_graph.  This is mostly designed for cases where :order should be qualified in other cases, but using a qualification breaks eager_graph because the correct qualifier is not known until runtime.</p>
</li><li>
<p>SQL::AliasedExpression#alias has been added as an alias for aliaz.</p>
</li></ul>

<ul><li>
<p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a> will now automatically use an eager limit strategy for *_one associations that use an :order option.  For associations that are truly one-to-one, an :order option is not needed, so it only makes sense to have an :order option if the association could theoretically return multiple results (in which case an eager limit strategy is helpful).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The queries that <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a> uses to filter by associations when those associations have conditions are now simpler and easier for the database to execute.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The queries that <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a> uses for dataset associations now handle cases where unqualified identifiers were used in the receiving dataset that would be made ambiguous by a join.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A limit strategy is now used when filtering by associations if the association has a limit and the database supports window functions.  This allows <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a> to setup a correct filter in such cases.</p>

<p>A limit strategy is now used in the dataset_associations plugin if the association has a limit and the database supports window functions.  This makes the resulting datasets return correct results.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first_10_albums</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># ORDER BY release_date</span>
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>You can now pass symbols with embedded qualifiers or aliases, as well as SQL::Identifier, SQL::QualifiedIdentifier, and SQL::AliasedExpression objects as the first argument to Dataset#graph.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The nested_attributes plugin now automatically handles presence validations on foreign keys when creating associated objects. It now sets the foreign key value (or a placeholder value) before validating such objects.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Offsets on *_one associations are now respected when using eager_graph.</p>
</li><li>
<p>eager graphing *_many associations with offsets no longer breaks if there are no associated results.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Database#register_array_type in the pg_array extension now works correctly if there is no existing scalar conversion proc for the type.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Unique, foreign key, and not null constraint violations are now recognized correctly on SQLite 3.8.2+.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The odbc adapter now returns fractional seconds in timestamps.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The obdc/mssql adapter now inputs timestamps with 3 decimal places.</p>
</li></ul>
